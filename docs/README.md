# Return App V3 <sup>BETA</sup>

Return app v3 is still in BETA. Docs are WIP.

## Description

The **Return App** gives merchants the ability to manage the Return Request Process on their store. 

## Features

### Admin Return Request List
In this section of the merchant's admin, merchants are capable of visualizing and managing all the return requests created by their customers. 
### Admin Return Settings
In this section of the merchant's admin, merchants control what are the conditions of allowing the return process for a given item or items per customer. 
- **Max Days**: when an order creation date is older than the Max Days to return, user won't be able to select that order for a return
- **Terms and Conditions**: link to the Terms and conditions offered by the store. (not provided by the app)
- **Excluded categories**: List of categories to be excluded for the return process. Any item that belongs to any of these categories, will not be allowed to be returned.
- **Return Payment Options**: 

  -- Same as Order: Payment will be refunded to the same payment method used in the order. 

  -- Allowed to choose: customer will select any of the refund options selected by the store. 
      **Disclaimer**: Only Credit Card triggers the automatic refund. **WIP: automatic refund for any payment method. **
- **Custom Return Reasons**: Allows the store to define their own custom return reasons. This setting will overwrite the default reasons. 
    |Default return reason|
    |---------|
    |Accidental Order|
    |Better Price|
    |Performance|
    |Incompatible|
    |Item Damaged|
    |Missed Delivery|
    |Missing Parts|
    |Box Damaged|
    |Different Product|
    |Defective|
    |Arrived in addition|
    |No Longer Needed|
    |Unauthorized purchase|
    |Different from website|

- **Other Option**: toggle this to include a generic other return request reason
- **Allow PickUp Points**: allow the customer to set a pick up point to drop off the items to return. 
- **Proportional shipping value**: the shipping value to be refunded per item will be automatically calculated based on the item weight on the total order value. 

### Transactional Emails
The app leverages the capabilites of VTEX Message Center to notify the customers when a return request is created and when the status of their return changes. 

The app creates a default template `oms-return-request-confirmation` that is modifiable on the Message Center to suit each store needs. 

Additional to this template, in the case there are secondary languages on the account, a new template is created per locale based on the `cultureInfoData` to provide customers the ability to internationalize their templates. 

Each new template will include the locale appendend to the default template title for example: `oms-return-request-confirmation-en-GB`.
